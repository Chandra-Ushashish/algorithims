Dijsktra's algotithim 

very similar to Prims algorithim of minimum spanning tree 

the aim of this algorithim is to find the minimum spanning distance from the  source to the 
other vertices of a  weighted   graph 

the source is always initialized as 0 and all the other vertices are intialized as infinity 
so we first create a empty priority queue or a min heap 
then we initailize the source distannce as 0 and all the other distances as infinity 
then we insert all distances into  the priority queue 
then we run a while loop untill the queue is empty
