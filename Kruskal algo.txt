Kruskal's algorithim :-
 
So this is a greedy algorithim ,which is used to minimum spanning tree of a weighted 
connected graph.

So the steps to applying kruskal algo is as follows:-
1.we need to sort the edges of the weighted graph in non-decreasing order of their weights 
2.Then we need to choose the smallest edge and check if it performs a cycle in the spanning 
   tree or not , if not then we add it to the list of vertces  of the minimum spanning tree
   if it forms a cycle then we simply discrd it 
3. we need to repeat step 2 untill the mst has (v-1) edges with v as the number of edges
   of the spanning tree (As we remember that a mst has always 1 edge less than the total
   number of edges of the tree)

Pseudo code for Kruskal algo:-
   
   KRUSKAL(G):
A = ∅
For each vertex v ∈ G.V:
    MAKE-SET(v)
For each edge (u, v) ∈ G.E ordered by increasing order by weight(u, v):
    if FIND-SET(u) ≠ FIND-SET(v):       
    A = A ∪ {(u, v)}
    UNION(u, v)
return A

the time complexity of kruskal algo is O(ElogV)
