Dijsktra's algotithim 

very similar to Prims algorithim of minimum spanning tree 

the aim of this algorithim is to find the minimum spanning distance from the  source to the 
other vertices of a  weighted   graph 

the source is always initialized as 0 and all the other vertices are intialized as infinity 
so we first create a empty priority queue or a min heap 
then we initailize the source distannce as 0 and all the other distances as infinity 
then we insert all distances into  the priority queue 
then we run a while loop untill the queue is empty 
now inside the while loop we extract the minimum node  and relax the adjacents of that node 	


peusdo code for Dijsktra's algorithim 

unction dijkstra(G, S)
    for each vertex V in G
        distance[V] <- infinite
        previous[V] <- NULL
        If V != S, add V to Priority Queue Q
    distance[S] <- 0
	
    while Q IS NOT EMPTY
        U <- Extract MIN from Q
        for each unvisited neighbour V of U
            tempDistance <- distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V)
            if tempDistance < distance[V]
                distance[V] <- tempDistance
                previous[V] <- U
    return distance[], previous[]
