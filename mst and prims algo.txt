Minimum spanning tree:-

if the tree had v vertices then a mst would have a v-1 edges
it should'nt be cyclic 

Prim's alogorithim :-
used to find minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph 
what we do is we maintain two sets ,one set is for the vertices which are included in 
the mst and the other one is the one not included in the mst and our goal is to move all 
vertices from the non-included one to the included one to the included one .

Pseudo code for Prim's algo:-

The pseudocode for prim's algorithm shows how we create two sets
of vertices U and V-U. U contains the list of vertices that have been visited and 
V-U the list of vertices that haven't. 
One by one, we move vertices from set V-U to set U by connecting the least weight edge.

T = ∅;
U = { 1 };
while (U ≠ V)
    let (u, v) be the lowest cost edge such that u ∈ U and v ∈ V - U;
    T = T ∪ {(u, v)}
    U = U ∪ {v}
    
    time complexity of this code would be O(v^2)
